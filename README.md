# About The Project

PlannH3R: the app that syncs your productivity with your menstrual cycle. Plan your activities efficiently according to your cycle phases, stay motivated with rewards, and discover how the connection between body and mind optimizes performance.

---

# Problem

**Lack of awareness about how the menstrual cycle affects productivity**  
Women experience fluctuations in energy and productivity throughout the cycle, but there‚Äôs often little awareness of how these changes impact daily performance.

- **Disconnection between well-being and goals**  
Current linear tools, combined with the lack of integration between personal planning and the menstrual cycle, make it difficult to align goals with physical and emotional needs.

- **Lack of motivation**  
There are no solutions that encourage task completion, promote discipline, reward achievements, and are aligned with menstrual cycle phases to drive results.

---

# Solution

PlannH3R syncs productivity with the phases of the menstrual cycle through a personalized calendar that adapts and suggests tasks and projects for each phase. It promotes efficient planning and motivation through rewards and access to wellness products and services upon achieving goals, while helping users understand how the body-mind connection boosts productivity.
